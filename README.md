# Custom-Text-Selection-Handles
This customizes text selection handles in Androidâ€™s TextView and EditText using reflection to replace default handles with custom drawables. However, it may break in future updates and does not work for WebView. Alternatives include themes, third-party libraries, or custom text editors for better stability.
