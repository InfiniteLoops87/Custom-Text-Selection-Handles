# 📌 Custom Text Selection Handles - Documentation  

## 📝 Purpose  
This snippet allows you to **customize the default text selection handles** in Android's `TextView` and `EditText`. Using **reflection**, it replaces the standard selection handles with **custom drawable resources**.  

---

## 📦 Required Imports  
Ensure you have the following import for reflection:  

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

💡 Note: In Sketchware, importing android.graphics.drawable.Drawable is unnecessary.

🎨 Available Selection Handles

You can modify the following selection handles:

🔹 Left Handle: mTextSelectHandleLeftRes

🔹 Right Handle: mTextSelectHandleRightRes

🔹 Middle Handle: mTextSelectHandleRes (used for dragging selection)

🖥️ Compatibility with Other Views

✅ Works For:

✔️ TextView
✔️ EditText

❌ Does Not Work For:

❌ WebView (renders web content separately using Chromium)

For WebView, use CSS & JavaScript:

::selection {
    background: #ffcc00; /* Custom selection color */
    color: #000;
}


❌ Buttons, Checkboxes, or Custom Views

If you need custom selection handles, consider implementing your own selection mechanism using onTouchListener.

⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ Uses reflection to access private fields inside TextView.
2️⃣ Replaces the default selection handle resources with custom drawables from res/drawable.
3️⃣ Updates the mEditor object dynamically to apply the changes.

⚠️ Disadvantages & Considerations

❗ Reflection Risks: Accessing private fields might break in future Android versions.
❗ Device Compatibility Issues: Some devices may not support this modification.
❗ Performance Impact: Reflection is slower compared to direct API usage.
❗ Limited Official Support: Google discourages reflection for modifying private fields.


---

✅ Best Practices

✔️ Use this method only if absolutely necessary.
✔️ Test across multiple Android versions to ensure compatibility.
✔️ Keep backup implementations in case the method stops working.

🔄 Alternative Solutions

🔹 Use Themes: Customize text selection using android:theme.
🔹 Third-Party Libraries: Some libraries provide custom selection functionality.
🔹 Custom Text Editor: Create a custom selection UI for better control.
🔹 For WebView: Use CSS & JavaScript instead of native Android selection.

🎯 Conclusion

This snippet customizes selection handles effectively, but it comes with risks and compatibility concerns. Always consider alternative approaches for better long-term stability.
