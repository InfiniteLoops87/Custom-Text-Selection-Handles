## Available Selection Handles

You can modify the following selection handles:

* **Left Handle**: `mTextSelectHandleLeftRes`

* **Right Handle**: `mTextSelectHandleRightRes`

* **Middle Handle**: `mTextSelectHandleRes` 

---

## Compatibility with Other Views

### Works For (Only checked ones):

- [x] `TextView`

- [x] `EditText`

- [ ] `WebView` 

- [ ] Buttons, Checkboxes, or Custom Views


> [!NOTE]
> For custom views, consider implementing your own selection mechanism using `onTouchListener`.

---

## How It Works

* Uses **reflection** to access private fields inside `TextView`.


* Replaces the default selection handle resources with **custom drawables** from `res/drawable`.


* Updates the `mEditor` object dynamically to apply the changes.

---

## Disadvantages & Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> Reflection involves accessing private fields, which may break in future Android versions.

> [!WARNING]
> Some devices may not support this modification, leading to compatibility issues.

> [!WARNING]
> Reflection is slower compared to direct API usage and may impact performance.

> [!WARNING]
> Google discourages modifying private fields via reflection, limiting official support.

## Best Practices

* Use this method **only if absolutely necessary**.

* Test across **multiple Android versions** to ensure compatibility.

* Keep **backup implementations** in case the method stops working.

---

## Alternative Solutions

* **Use Themes**: Customize text selection using `android:theme`.

* **Third-Party Libraries**: Some libraries provide custom selection functionality.

* **Custom Text Editor**: Create a custom selection UI for better control.

## Conclusion

* This snippet customizes selection handles effectively, but it comes with **risks and compatibility concerns**. Always consider alternative approaches for **better long-term stability**.
